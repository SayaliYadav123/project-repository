  <h1>Flea Infestation Information</h1>
  <p>
    Fleas are small, wingless insects that feed on the blood of mammals and birds. 
    Flea infestations commonly affect cats, dogs, and other animals, as well as humans.
  </p>
  <h2>Symptoms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Intense itching and scratching</li>
    <li>Red, irritated skin</li>
    <li>Small red bumps or welts</li>
    <li>Hair loss or thinning fur</li>
    <li>Presence of flea dirt (black specks) on the skin or in the fur</li>
    <li>Restlessness or discomfort</li>
    <li>Secondary skin infections (due to scratching)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Treatment</h2>
  <p>
    Treatment of flea infestations involves both addressing the fleas on the pet and eliminating them from the environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    For pets, various flea control products such as topical spot-on treatments, oral medications, flea collars, and shampoos are available. 
    It is essential to follow the instructions provided by your veterinarian and the product manufacturer carefully.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, thorough cleaning of the pet's environment is crucial to remove flea eggs, larvae, and pupae. 
    Vacuuming carpets, upholstery, and pet bedding, as well as washing pet bedding in hot water, can help eliminate fleas and their life stages.
  </p>
  <p>
    In severe infestations or if secondary skin infections occur, it may be necessary to consult with a veterinarian for additional treatment options.
