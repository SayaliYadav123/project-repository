  <h1>Fever Information</h1>
  <p>
    Fever is a common symptom characterized by an elevation in body temperature, often in response to an infection or illness.
    It is the body's natural response to fight off infections and stimulate the immune system.
  </p>
  <h2>Symptoms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Elevated body temperature above the normal range (typically 98.6째F or 37째C)</li>
    <li>Chills or shivering</li>
    <li>Sweating</li>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Muscle aches</li>
    <li>Weakness or fatigue</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Dehydration (especially if fever is accompanied by vomiting or diarrhea)</li>
    <li>Other symptoms depending on the underlying cause of the fever</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Treatment</h2>
  <p>
    Treatment for fever typically focuses on addressing the underlying cause and relieving discomfort.
    Depending on the severity and cause of the fever, treatment may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Over-the-counter fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)</li>
    <li>Rest and hydration to support the body's immune response</li>
    <li>Treating the underlying infection or illness with antibiotics, antiviral medications, or other specific treatments</li>
    <li>Cooling measures such as tepid sponge baths, wearing lightweight clothing, or using fans</li>
    <li>Seeking medical attention if the fever persists, is accompanied by severe symptoms, or if there are concerns about its underlying cause</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It is important to monitor fever closely, especially in infants, young children, elderly individuals, and those with weakened immune systems, as they may be at higher risk of complications.
    If fever is persistently high (above 103째F or 39.4째C), lasts for more than a few days, or is associated with severe symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.
